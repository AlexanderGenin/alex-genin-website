# Alex Genin Portfolio Website

âœŒ This website was designed and developed to introduce myself to the world and showcase my skills and experience. \
ðŸ™‚ Feel free to take a look ðŸ‘€ at the live version: [alexgenin.com](https://alexgenin.com).

This project was built with React and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
